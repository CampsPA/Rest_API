Project Overview

The client is a company called Globoticket, and they sell tickets for events such as concerts.
Currently their systems are using a legacy system where part of the data is stored in a database, 
the database howver contains only part of the data, the other part of the data is stored in so-called 
frontmatter files, represented here by the YAML file icon. 
That means that we also have text files that contains other things like the name of the event, the artist,
a description, and more. So for every product to get all information, we need to consult both 
databases and find the correct frontmatter file with extra data and then combine that. 
Currently, their website but also their other systems like billing connect to two different data 
sources to gather everything they need. Instead, they would like us to build a REST API, 
which connects to both data sources and presents a unified interface.
The client has plans to create a new website and a mobile app and maybe more things in the future,
 and they want to be independent of the actual technology used to store the data.
Instead, all systems should just talk to the REST API and be independent of the rest.
That way, they can decide to change the way the data is stored, maybe by moving everything into a 
database or use cloud storage without having to change any of the frontâ€‘end systems. 
Those will only depend on the API. And when something changes in the data storage, 
we would only have to update the API.
